                Luigi's Mansion was one of my key inspirations for this game. It creates an experience that is both tense and exciting for the player through its elaborate atmosphere, labyrinthine layout and spooky elements. In this game, the player takes on the role of Luigi and explores the ghost-filled mansion, using a variety of tools and strategies to deal with the paranormal. This combination of adventurous, spooky, and puzzle-solving elements had a big impact on my game development.

                In Luigi's Mansion, ghosts are not just enemies, but are central to the entire story and atmosphere of the game, and players need to overcome the challenges they pose through strategy and courage. Also in my game, ghosts and cow guards are important obstacle elements that symbolise unpredictable supernatural forces, and I added audio effects to bring the player the tension of exploring the mansion, making the player face unknown risks every time they turn a corner.

                On the edge of the city, there is an old abandoned mansion, shrouded in a mysterious mist for years, that few dare to approach. Legends abound about the house; some say it was once home to the rich and famous, but due to a bizarre fire and the mysterious deaths that followed, the house was left vacant. The spirits of these deaths did not leave; they became the ghostly guardians of the house, sworn to protect its secrets and treasures.
        
                Sam, a professional thief who thrives on adventure, aims to steal the precious gem that is said to be hidden in the mansion. The jewel is rumoured to possess strange powers that can grant its possessor great wealth and wisdom, but only if it can be successfully taken away from these guardians. And those guardians are the ghosts and the cows.
